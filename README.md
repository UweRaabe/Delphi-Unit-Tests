# Welcome to the Delphi Unit Tests Project

This is a public, open source project for the Delphi community to build up a set of unit tests for Delphi's libraries.  

Delphi community members are encouraged to fork the repository, add tests, and create a pull request.  Embarcadero employees are particularly encouraged to add tests from the internal tests that are run with official Delphi builds.

The testing framework used for the is DUnitX.  It can be found here:

[https://github.com/VSoftTechnologies/DUnitX](https://github.com/VSoftTechnologies/DUnitX)

In order to run the tests, you need to create an environmental variable called $(DUNITX) that points to the base directory for DUnitX.  

Please see the project's wiki for more information.
